#### Build to learn

**Who is this application for?**  
Slack users...specifically Chingu slack groups!

**What problem will this application attempt to solve?**  
Potentially 3:
1: Make finding info on our fellow chingu's more accessable.
2: Build a stronger community by highlighting shared interests.
3: Archive user data.

**How will this application solve this problem?**  
1: It will scrape and coalesce specifically the data from the "add-your-intro-here" channel and make it more searchable.
2: It will use basic AI to create tags from highly used keywords within the data and associate those with each user.
3: It will persist data to a data store.

**What is the minimum viable product?**  
A front end with editable user profiles and keyword tags comprised from data from our slack group. A back end that does the scraping and persists modified data to a database.
